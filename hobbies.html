          <h1>Triathlon</h1>
          <h3>My first triathlon began as an event for the Boy Scouts program in AZ. I loved the race and
            and have only grown to love it more with each race moving onto races in places like Lake Powell and
            racing over the London Bridge in Havasu City, Arizona. Since starting the furthest race that I
            have completed is an Olympic distance triathlon (1 mile swim, 25 mile bike ride, and 6.2 miles of running). I
            hope to continue this interest with eventually completing an IronMan Triathlon. It would be a dream to complete
            and qualify for the big race held yearly in Kona, Hawaii!
          </h3>
          <h1>Hiking</h1>
          <h3> I love the outdoors and exploring new places. I have always enjoyed hiking, but as time goes on I have
            been able to find more places to go. Most of places that I have gone to have been local, but I have
            gone to places like Zions National Park and hiked Havasupai in the Grand Canyon. I am always up for
            exploring a new location!
          </h3>
          <h1>Technology</h1>
          <h3>My whole life I have been fascinated by the improvements in technology and what the future can hold.
          I love to look up the new technology that companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and others have been
          releasing and I would love to become a part of it someday. It has also been interesting to see how these
	        companies have been growing and to think about what steps that I hope that they will
          take. Watching
          conferences like the WWDC by Apple have always been exciting.
          </h3>
